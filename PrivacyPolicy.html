        <h3>What we do with the information we gather</h3>
        <p>We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internal record keeping;</li>
            <li>We may use the information to improve our services;</li>
            <li>Where we have clearly stated and made you aware of the fact, and where you have given your express permission, except for where we have legitimate interests in doing so, we may use your details to send you information related to our services/products through a mailing list system. This is done in accordance with the regulations named above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Security and Retention of Data</h3>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. For this purpose, we will not hold your personal data for any longer than is reasonable. Further, we have taken reasonable steps to protect your information against unauthorised access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, damage and destruction. Nevertheless, any personal data submitted by you is at your own risk.<br>
        We will not transfer your personal details to any third party for the purpose of direct marketing without your permission. We use certain third party service providers who may have access to your personal data so that they can provide services to us. When this occurs, we have a data protection compliant contract in place with these third parties. If you provided your details through our website then Jump Ltd who manages our online strategy will have access to your details.</p>
        <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>This website uses cookies to better understand the user’s experience while visiting the website. Cookies are small files saved to the user’s computer’s hard drive that track, save and store information about the user’s interactions and usage of the website. This allows the website, through its server, to provide the users with a tailored experience within this website.<br>
        Users are advised that if they wish to deny the use and saving of cookies from this website onto their computer’s hard drive they should take necessary steps within their web browser’s security settings to block all cookies from this website and its external serving vendors or use the cookie control system if available upon their first visit.</p>
        <h3>Measuring Website Usage (Google Analytics)</h3>
        <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use this website. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements.<br>

        </ul>
        <p>We don’t collect or store your personal information (for example your name or address) so this information can’t be used to identify who you are. We don’t allow Google to use or share our analytics data.<br>

            <tr><th>Name</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Expires</th></tr>
            <tr><td>_utma</td><td>Like _ga, this lets us know if you’ve visited before, so we can count how many of our visitors are new to the site or to a certain page</td><td>2 years</td></tr>
            <tr><td>_utmb</td><td>This works with _utmc to calculate the average length of time you spend on the site</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr>
