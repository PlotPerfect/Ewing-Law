                    <p><strong>Frequently instructed to defend in major, nationally reported criminal trials, Ewing Law is a recognised leader when it comes to serious/complex crime.</strong></p>
                    <p>With the experience and expertise to deliver in even the most serious, complex and high profile of criminal cases, our practice ranges from murder to large scale drug conspiracies, and from kidnap, blackmail and armed robberies to allegations of a sexual nature, particularly those within the media and sporting sectors. In addition we have a particular and much sought after expertise in the fields of corruption, bribery and money laundering.</p>
                    <p>With decades of experience to call upon, our team members have been instructed to defend in cases brought by all of the major UK prosecuting bodies, including but not limited to the Crown Prosecution Service, the CPS Special Case Work Unit, The National Crime Agency, the Serious Fraud Office, Her Majesty’s Insolvency Service, the Health and Safety Executive, the Department of Work and Pensions, the Financial Conduct Authority and more. This wealth of experience makes Ewing Law the logical choice for any individual or company subject to investigation by any prosecuting body within the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>We are regularly instructed to defend nationwide, with our reputation in this area of law taking us from London to Newcastle and everywhere in between. In addition, our team members in recent times have worked internationally in states such as Spain, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Portugal, Cyprus, Ireland, China, Barbados, Philippines and Hong Kong.</p>

                    <h1>White Collar Crime Defence</h1>
                    <p><strong>Ewing Law is recognised as one of the leading defence firms in the field of white collar crime. With practically every member of the core team having specialised in defending the most complex allegations, together they possess unrivalled experience in every variation of white collar crime, including boiler-room, carousel and ponzi frauds, money laundering, insider trading, bribery and corruption.</strong></p>
                    <p>Led by Principal Solicitor Scott Ewing – long regarded as the ‘go-to’ lawyer throughout the City of London in respect of fraud allegations and regulatory advice – our lawyers have been instructed in many of the largest, most complicated fraud trials of the past 20 years.</p>
                    <p>Our team have also been involved in some of the biggest confiscation proceedings brought since the introduction of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, where their various successes have left Ewing Law in such demand that we are now often approached to privately undertake POCA proceedings, even when not instructed in the original case.</p>

Following conviction for conspiracy to supply Class A Drugs, the Crown sought to confiscate the Defendant’s assets as the proceeds of crime. This was successfully contested on the basis that the Defendant’s assets were in fact the result of his ownership of a string of highly-profitable sado-masochistic ‘dungeons’, and that these could not be seized as the proceeds of crime in the absence of a prosecution for the offence of living off of immoral earnings.<br>Maidstone Crown Court</div>

The Department of Work and Pensions sought review of this decision in to the Administrative Court, where the decision of the Crown Court judge was upheld.

We accept instructions in these types of cases on a private paying basis only.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:0;">Whilst legal aid is generally available for offences of this type (subject to means testing), the rates paid are very low and as such it is extremely difficult to properly prepare such a case to Ewing Law’s exacting standards, and equally difficult to find a suitably able barrister willing to act. Ewing Law will therefore only accept these cases on a private basis, to ensure that our clients are properly represented at every stage and that they enjoy the best possible defence team.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:2rem; font-family:'Crimson Text',serif; color:#1a3a24; font-weight:400; line-height:1.15; margin-bottom:2rem;">Ewing Law accepts private instruction to act on behalf of the defence in respect of any and all alleged motoring offences.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Whilst some build a brand around the concept of loophole defences, at Ewing Law we simply instruct the best, most experienced road-traffic barristers to study every case in detail and identify any technical or procedural defences which may be available. In addition, our specialists will advise fully and realistically on any factual defence advanced by our clients, and we routinely instruct experts in the field of alcoholic dissipation, GATSO (and other speed camera) calibration/accuracy and vehicle performance to challenge the prosecution case.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Those who bring allegations of road traffic violation to our team can be assured of honest, up-to-date and wholly realistic advice. If there is a factual defence with a reasonable prospect of success, we will tell you. If there is a technical or procedural point to be raised, we will advise you. But if there is no chance of success, or if our client is hoping for a ‘loophole’ which no longer exists, we will advise of this also. At Ewing Law our client is our number one priority, and we have no wish to pursue any case that is not in that client’s interest.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:0;">Due to our policy of offering the utmost discretion to our clients – high-profile or otherwise – we cannot offer a case list in this area of practice.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">These have ranged from Health and Safety prosecutions to allegations of Food Standard Agency violations, and to matters brought before the General Medical Council, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the General Dental Council and the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">In addition to regulatory prosecutions we have for many years represented professional sportsmen and sportswomen before the governing bodies of their chosen sport. This experience has in the main been before the Amateur Boxing Association, The British Boxing Board of Control and the Rugby Football Union and the United Kingdom Anti-Doping Panel, but has also included the Football Association.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:2.5rem;">Ewing Law has defended these matters at all levels, from the Magistrates Court through to the High Court and all the way to the Court of Appeal.</p>

The suspension came after an arrest for an allegation of drug dealing, for which Scott Ewing and Tony Wyatt acted as solicitor and barrister respectively, securing an acquittal of the charges. The application for the return of the defendant’s licence was successful, allowing him to compete in the 2012 Olympics where he won a Gold Medal before embarking on a high-profile professional career.</div>

(a major poultry slaughterhouse) in resisting the decision of the Food Standards Agency to close its main plant following failure to achieve ‘full approval’ of its working practices. The outcome of the matter was of particular importance as success for F. would undermine the legality of the policies adopted by the Food Standards Agency. This matter was considered by the Administrative Court in 2011, at which time the approach of the Food Standards Agency to the grant of both conditional and full approval to trade was considered to be unlawful from the Agency’s inception, due to a misapplication of the legislation. ‘The Official Feed and Food Controls (England)(Amendment) Regulations 2011’ have been implemented as a result of this case.</div>

The most successful, however, will do the same in respect of whether their proposed actions carry any technical criminal or regulatory breaches.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">As a result of our many years at the very forefront of white collar criminal defence and regulatory law, the Ewing Law team are well versed in the more technical aspects of what can and cannot constitute a ‘fraud’, in both the criminal and civil sense. We are also very aware of what seemingly innocuous actions would amount to a breach of regulatory rules in, for example, the financial sector. This expertise has left us in great demand when it comes to providing preemptory advice to bankers, traders and entrepreneurs, to ensure that their proposed actions or business conduct is both wholly legal and within the bounds of their own regulatory rules.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Believing strongly than crime prevention is preferable criminal defence, our founder and Principal Solicitor takes the lead with the criminal and regulatory aspect of this advisory service. Over the years Scott’s advice has seen many well known institutions and individuals change their intended courses of conduct to ensure that their actions are sound from both a legally and regulatory position, saving them money and sleepless nights in the process.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Ewing Law’s services in this respect are often offered alongside the commercial version of the same from our sister-firm Buks, and are often supported – where requested – by the advice of specialist Queen’s Counsel.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#1a3a24; font-family:'Segoe UI',Arial,sans-serif; margin-bottom:0;">Our advisory services are offered internationally.</p>
